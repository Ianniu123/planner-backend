To Do: 
- add courses by dragging
- better ui for displaying courses
- filtering (by level) and search button
- being able to save the selected courses (unique by ip)

Details that can be improved:
- When you remove courses, add the course back to the filter (display)
- dealing with duplicated courses (replacement request)
